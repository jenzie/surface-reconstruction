\begin{abstract}The purpose of this paper is to utilize a technique for recreating models of 3-D objects. This process is referred to as surface reconstruction, which replaces a set of sample points using a faceted geometric model. Concepts of graph theory are used, specifically duals of graphs, n-regular graphs, bridgeless graphs, and matchings.
