Graph Theory & Surface Reconstruction
=====================================

Research paper on surface reconstruction and graph theory.  

"The purpose of this paper is to utilize a technique to recreate models of 3-D objects.
This process is referred to as surface reconstruction, which replaces a set of sample
points using a faceted geometric model. Multiple concepts from graph theory are
used, specically duals of graphs, n-regular graphs, bridgeless graphs, and matchings.
Weighted and unweighted mergings of faces are also discussed to address issues of
distortion resulting from mergings."
